<h1>E-mail help</h1>
<h2>I'm not receiving my e-mails</h2>
If you have configured Network Monitor to send yourself reports by e-mail using a Gmail account, you may need to configure Gmail to grant Network Monitor SMTP access.
<br/>
<br/>
There are two ways to allow Network Monitor to send mail using your Gmail account.
<h3>Recommended: 2-step verification</h3>
Enable 2-step verification, and then generate an app password which you can enter in Network Monitor instead of your Gmail password. You can do this here:
<ul>
 <li><a href="https://www.google.com/landing/2step/">Enable 2-step verification</a></li>
 <li><a href="https://support.google.com/accounts/answer/185833">Generate an app password</a></li>

</ul>
<br/>
<h3>Less secure:</h3>
If you haven't enabled 2-step verification in Gmail, you can allow all "less secure" apps to access Gmail.  In this case, you enter your Gmail password inside Network Monitor. <br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Please note that enabling access to less secure applications can make your Gmail account more vulnerable.
