<h1>Network Monitor basic speed test</h1>
The Network Monitor speed test is a simple speed test which may not be as accurate as tests performed by other apps which specialize in speed tests.

<br/>
<br/>
Network Monitor is a completely free app, with no ads, maintained by one hobbyist, and the author of this app cannot pay for a dedicated server for thousands of users to constantly run speed tests.

<br/>
<br/>
So, in Network Monitor, you must choose a server on which to perform the speed test.

<br/>
<br/>
<h2>Download test (http)</h2>
For the download speed test, you select a url of any file to download.  The bigger the file, the more accurate the test will be, but the greater the possibility of exceeding your data quota, if you have one.

<br/>
<br/>
<h2>Upload test (ftp)</h2>
For the upload speed test, Network Monitor will upload the file downloaded from the download speed test, to an FTP server.  You must have access to an FTP server and provide the login credentials, if you wish to perform the upload speed test.

<br/>
<br/>
If you wish, you may run only the download speed test without running the upload speed test.

<br/>
<br/>
<h2>Want something more?</h2>
If you want an app specialized in speed tests, don't hesitate to search the Play Store.
